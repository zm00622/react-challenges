Save your files from each challenge in this folder (the SaveYourSolutionsHere folder).

To keep everything organized, please follow the file naming convention below:

FILES:

  This naming convention utilizes the version system often seen used by software companies.
You've probably seen this before. Consider Bobs Software company... Bob might name their
first set of software as GoBob. Later on down the road, after Bobs Software works out the
bugs and adds features, they might name it GoBob1.2 (short for GobBob Version 2).


For the coding problems you answer here, please save your files as such.

challenge1.js (This would be the name of your FIRST solution for the component that handles your JavaScript and JSX/HTML for Challenge 1.)

challenge1.2.js (This would be the name of your SECOND (i.e., better and optimized) solution for the component that handles your JavaScript and JSX/HTML for Challenge 1.)

challenge2.js (This would be the name of your FIRST solution for the component that handles your JavaScript and JSX/HTML for Challenge 2.)

challenge2.2.js (This would be the name of your SECOND (i.e., better and optimized) solution for the component that handles your JavaScript and JSX/HTML for Challenge 2.)

etc. etc.


FOLDERS:

Or, save each problem into its own folder:

Challenge1 (Which is a folder that would contain challenge1.js, challenge1.css, etc.)
Challenge2 (Which is a folder that would contain it's own challenge2.js, challenge2.css etc.)

If you optimize a solution, a new folder would be created as follows:

Challenge1.2 (Which is a folder that contains the optimized files for Challenge 1, which should now be named challenge1.2.js, challenge1.2.css etc.)
